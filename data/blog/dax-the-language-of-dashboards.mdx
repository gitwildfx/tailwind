# Lab 1: Basic Aggregations
**Learn**: SUM()
**Goal**: Calculate total sales.

```DAX
Total Sales = SUM ( Sales[Sales Amount] )
```

ðŸ”Ž Explanation:  
This measure sums all values in [Sales Amount]. It dynamically adjusts based on filters like year, region, or product.


## Lab 2: Conditional Totals
**Learn**: CALCULATE() with filters  
**Goal**: Return sales only for 2025.

Sales 2025 = CALCULATE ( SUM ( Sales[Sales Amount] ), Sales[Year] = 2025 )

ðŸ”Ž Explanation:  
CALCULATE changes the filter contextâ€”here it restricts totals to the year 2025.


## Lab 3: Querying with EVALUATE
**Learn**: FILTER() with queries  
**Goal**: Return products with low stock, sorted alphabetically.

```DAX
EVALUATE
    FILTER ( DimProduct, DimProduct[SafetyStockLevel] < 200 )
ORDER BY DimProduct[EnglishProductName] ASC
```

ðŸ”Ž Explanation:  
FILTER extracts only products where stock is under 200.  
ORDER BY sorts them alphabetically.  
EVALUATE outputs the result (run in DAX Studio).


## Lab 4: Variables & Return Logic
**Learn**: VAR and RETURN  
**Goal**: Apply discounts or penalties depending on total quantity.

```DAX
VAR TotalQty = SUM ( Sales[Quantity] )
RETURN
    IF (
        TotalQty > 1000,
        TotalQty * 0.95,
        TotalQty * 1.25
    )
```

ðŸ”Ž Explanation:  
VAR stores values, RETURN outputs logic.  
If total > 1000 â†’ 5% discount. Otherwise â†’ 25% markup.


## Lab 5: Time Intelligence
**Learn**: TOTALYTD()  
**Goal**: Show cumulative sales year-to-date.

```DAX
YTD Sales = TOTALYTD ( SUM ( Sales[Sales Amount] ), 'Date'[Date] )
```

ðŸ”Ž Explanation:  
TOTALYTD aggregates sales from the start of the year to the current date in context.

## Wrap-Up
DAX is more than formulasâ€”itâ€™s a **framework for analytics**.  
With these 5 labs, youâ€™ve learned how to:  
- Aggregate values with SUM  
- Control filter context with CALCULATE  
- Query and filter tables with EVALUATE  
- Simplify logic using VAR and RETURN  
- Apply time intelligence with TOTALYTD  

ðŸ‘‰ Next step: Try combining these concepts to calculate **Year-to-Date Sales by Region**, then compare it to last year using SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR.
