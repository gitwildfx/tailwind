### Python Set Union

Sometimes while coding we need to merge two pieces of information with a new source. This is where a [union](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_union.asp) function comes into play.

In Python, for instance, you’ll first want to establish your _set_. [Sets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-function-python/#) are unordered collections of unique elements. These are similar to arrays, although the union function will remove duplicates. This is key to saving time while developing and helps to order your processes more efficiently. Why write more code instead of less?

The following example outlines the simplicity of such reduction. Note the distinction between using sets as opposed to [arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_arrays.asp):

```python
# Set union example
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```

Joining former and latter data sets is not a new concept. In ancient times, Hebrew scribes would organize and compile vast amounts of records, from census data and temple procedures to prophetic warnings and even apocalyptic pronouncements. These documents would later be foundational to affirming Jesus as the Messianic fulfillment of God’s law, which in essence is a “union” between His Spirit and man:

> And Jesus said to them, ‘Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household, who brings out of his treasure things new and old.’ (Matthew 13:52 NASB)
