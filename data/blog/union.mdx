### Python Set Go

Often while coding, we need to merge two pieces of information with a new source. This is where the [union](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_union.asp) function comes into play.

In Python, you’ll first want to establish your _set_. [Sets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-function-python/#) are unordered collections of unique elements. These are similar to arrays, but the union function automatically removes duplicates. This feature is useful in saving time while developing and helps to streamline your processes. Why write more code when you can write less?

![Python Example](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b52ae0f7-dd92-4586-bcdb-8e41253dff20_800x576.gif)

```python
# Set union example
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```

Joining data sets is not a new concept. In ancient times, Hebrew scribes organized and compiled vast amounts of records, from census data and temple procedures to prophetic warnings and even apocalyptic pronouncements. These documents would later be foundational in affirming Jesus as the Messianic fulfillment of God’s law, symbolizing a “union” between His Spirit and man:

> And Jesus said to them, ‘Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household, who brings out of his treasure things new and old.’ (Matthew 13:52 NASB)
