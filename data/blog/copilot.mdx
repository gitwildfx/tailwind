In the era of artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and YouTube, we can faintly recall when civilization first journeyed to space. However, just like creation itself, animals were made first and sent ahead of man to populate the earth ([Genesis 1:24](https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm)).

The image above is of Félicette, who in 1961 made an epic journey to space. Fourteen female cats were employed by French CERMA space scientists, who fitted the felines with electrodes to record their brain activity. \[1\]

The cats literally underwent ‘astronaut training’ to test their reaction to being confined to long periods of isolation.

## ChatGPT: A New Era of Digital Assistants

Fast-forward nearly 60 years, and today we have digital personal assistants driven by advanced AI with near-infinite reach into the collective knowledge of mankind. Tools like [Microsoft’s Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot) and Google Gemini™ are changing the way we interact with data across every facet of life.

Copilot is one of several offerings from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), which according to ChatGPT was founded by some of the principal architects and proponents of Artificial Intelligence. These tools have the ability to transform our digital workspaces, including how we consume content and gather information.

## For Developers

It’s important to understand that ChatGPT tools are driven primarily by user-generated feedback. From a coding perspective, these inputs rely on algorithms and search indexing to cull the available public data lakes across the internet. Once the data is crawled and aggregated, OpenAI’s servers (likely [Quantum](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microsofts-majorana-1-chip-carves-new-path-for-quantum-computing/)) perform predictive analysis on common search queries to render a desired output (i.e., the more people use it, the better and *faster* it gets at determining what you want).
