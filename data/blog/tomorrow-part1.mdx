► *A 3-part series on finding a job and remaining hopeful for the future.*

## The Arc of Technological Change

In my generation, I've witnessed many new things. Modern computing, the Internet, and now Artificial Intelligence have swept the world over. Companies like **OpenAI**, **Microsoft**, **DeepSeek**, **Anthropic**, **xAI**, **Google**, and countless others are probing the depths of AI and altering how we think and interact with information.

With changing cultural norms, social and political challenges, and a global economic crisis emerging—not to mention a host of personal and societal struggles—one could hardly imagine an optimistic future.

## The Fourth Industrial Revolution

As a developer and citizen of humanity, I'm often overwhelmed with the coming fourth industrial revolution. What will the near future look like with advancements in genetics, augmented reality, robotics, and the like?

Will we still be creating content, or will machines be providing us with an endless stream of dopamine-laden experiences connected directly to a neural network in our brains?

*Great, now I'm sounding weird.*
"Excuse me—can we get to some code, please?"<br />
*Yes, we will.*

> *God has given both his promise and his oath... a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God’s inner sanctuary. Jesus has already gone in there for us. He has become our eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.* (Hebrews 6:18-20 NLT)
