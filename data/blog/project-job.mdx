### More in store

There is a lot in the works for WFx (too numerous to count) but I will say the most exciting thing is watching people learn and grow. That is what society desperately craves, more than having a machine do all the work. Who knows, maybe with a little bit of faith and luck, this just might touch an entire generation of young dreamers eager to launch their own startup one day :D
