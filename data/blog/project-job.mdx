## The test of attrition

All of us can identify with the struggles of learning new and difficult things. My first exposure to basic programming came through a free workshop on <a href="https://www.powershellengineer.com/archive" target="_blank">Powershell</a>. I need the skill for a job as a System Administrator, but for the life of me, I couldn't figure it out. In hindsight, those were the baby steps in my coding journey.

### Defined.

<em>/əˈtriSHən/</em>

### Example from Scripture

When considering the trials and challenges we each face in life, the biblical story of <a href="https://bibleproject.com/guides/book-of-job/" target="_blank">Job</a> often comes to remembrance. Essentially, Job was a righteous man who was allowed by God to be tested by the devil. This should all make us cringe to some degree, but it's important when considering the many difficulties we'll face on a coding project, technical interviews, or workplace drama that we'll face as developers. I recall many late evenings hammering away on code to no avail :/

1 But now, hear my speech, O Job,<br />
&ensp;&ensp;and listen to all my words.<br />
2 Behold, I open my mouth;<br />
&ensp;&ensp;the tongue in my mouth speaks.<br />
3 My words declare the uprighteness of my<br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;heart,<br />
&ensp;&ensp;and what my lips know they speak<br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;sincerely.<br />
4 The Spirit of God has made me,<br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;life.<br />
5 Answer me, if you can;<br />
&ensp;&ensp;set your words in order before me; take<br />
&ensp;&ensp;your stand<br />
6 Behold, I am toward God as you are;<br />
&ensp;&ensp;I too was pinched off from a piece of<br />
&ensp;&ensp;clay.<br />
7 Behold, no fear of me need terrify you;<br />
&ensp;&ensp;my pressure will not be heavy upong you.<br />
8 "Surely you have spoken in my ears,<br />
&ensp;&ensp;and I have heard the sound of your<br />
&ensp;&ensp;words.<br />
9 You say, 'I am pure, without transgression;<br />
&ensp;&ensp;I am clean, and there is no iniquity in<br />
&ensp;&ensp;me.<br />
10 Behold, he finds occassions against me,<br />
&ensp;&ensp;he counts me as his enemy,<br />
11 he puts my feet in the stocks<br />
&ensp;&ensp;and watches all my paths,'<br />
12 "Behold, in this you are not right. I will<br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;answer you,<br />
&ensp;&ensp;for God is greater than man.<br />
13 Why do you cotend against him,<br />
&ensp;&ensp;saying, 'He will answer none of man's<br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;words'?<br />
14 For God speaks in one way,<br />
&ensp;&ensp;and in two, though man does not per-<br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;ceive it.<br />
15 In a dream, in a vision of the night,<br />
&ensp;&ensp;when deep sleep falls on men,<br?
