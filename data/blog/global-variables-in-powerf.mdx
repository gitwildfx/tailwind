### Global Variables: A Game Changer

[![Launch editor](https://vercel.com/button)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables#use-a-global-variable)

### Introduction

My first post for the blog is to start with a really neat PowerFx function that is a game changer. _[Global variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables#use-a-global-variable)_ enable you to temporarily hold a piece of information and reuse it for other parts of your app. Unlike _context variables_, which are scoped to a single screen, global variables are available throughout your app on all screens. These are the simplest kind of variables for most situations.

### Setting Global Variables

Use the **Set** function to set the value of a global variable, which temporarily holds a piece of information, such as the number of times the user has selected a button or the result of a data operation.

```powerfx
Set(varGlobal, "Hello World!")
```

Global variables are implicitly created by using the **Set** function. No explicit declaration is required. If you remove all the **Set** functions for a global variable, that global variable will cease to exist. To clear a variable, set its value to the result of the **Blank** function.
