## Creating a Rotating Word Effect in Tailwind CSS

To create a rotating word effect (where words appear one after the other), you can use a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and some optional CSS for animation. Here's how you can implement it:

### HTML Code:
```html
<div class="text-center">
  <h1 class="typewriter text-4xl font-mono text-gray-800">
    <span id="rotating-text"></span>
  </h1>
</div>
