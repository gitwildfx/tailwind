## The test of attrition

All of us can identify with the struggles of learning new and difficult things. My first exposure to basic programming came through a free workshop on <a href="https://www.powershellengineer.com/archive" target="_blank">Powershell</a>. I need the skill for a job as a System Administrator, but for the life of me, I couldn't figure it out. In hindsight, those were the baby steps in my coding journey.

### Defined.

When considering the trials and challenges we each face in life, the biblical story of <a href="https://bibleproject.com/guides/book-of-job/" target="_blank">Job</a> often comes to remembrance. Essentially, Job was a righteous man who was allowed by God to be tested by the devil. This should all make us cringe to some degree, but it's important when considering the many difficulties we'll face on a coding project, technical interviews, or workplace drama that we'll face as developers. I recall many late evenings hammering away on code to no avail \:/

### Example (Job 33):

|                                                                                                           |                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 But now, hear my speech, O Job, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and listen to all my words.                             | 19 "Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and with continual strife in his bones,      |
| 2 Behold, I open my mouth; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;the tongue in my mouth speaks.                                 | 20 so that his life loathes bread, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and his appetite the choicest food.                   |
| 3 My words declare the uprightness of my <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;heart, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and what my lips know they speak <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;sincerely. | 21 His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and his bones that were not seen stick out. |
| 4 The Spirit of God has made me, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;life.                                           | 22 His soul draws near the pit, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and his life to those who bring death.                    |
| 5 Answer me, if you can; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;set your words in order before me; take <br /> &ensp;&ensp;your stand. | 23 If there by for him an angel, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;a mediator, one of the thousand, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;to declare to man what is right for him, |
| 6 Behold, I am toward God as you are; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;I too was pinched off from a piece of <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;clay. | 24 and he is merciful to him, and says, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;'Deliver him from going down into the pit; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;I have found a ransom; |
| 7 Behold, no fear of me need terrify you; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;my pressure will not be heavy upon you.           | 25 let his flesh become fresh with youth; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;let him return to the days of his youthful <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;vigor'; |
| 8 "Surely you have spoken in my ears, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and I have heard the sound of your <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;words. | 26 then man prays to God, and he accepts him; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;he sees his face with a shout of joy, <br /> and he restores to man his righteousness. |
| 9 You say, 'I am pure, without transgression; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;I am clean, and there is no iniquity in <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;me. | 27&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He sings before men and says: <br /> 'I have sinned and perverted what was right, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and it was not repaid to me. |
| 10 Behold, he finds occasions against me, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;he counts me as his enemy, <br />                 | 28 He had redeemed my soul from going down <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;into the pit, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and my life shall look upon the light.' |
| 11 he puts my feet in the stocks <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and watches all my paths,'                                 | 29 Behold, God does all these things, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;twice, three times, with a man, <br /> to bring back his soul from the pit, |
| 12 "Behold, in this you are not right. I will <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;answer you, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;for God is greater than man. | that he may be lighted with the light of <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;life. |
| 13 Why do you contend against him, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;saying, 'He will answer none of man's <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;words'? | 31 Pay close attention, O Job, listen to me; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;be silent, and I will speak. |
| 14 For God speaks in one way, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and in two, though man does not per- <br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;ceive it. | 32 If you have any words, answer me; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;speak, for I desire to justify you. |
| 15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, <br /> &ensp;&ensp;when deep sleep falls on men,                       | 33 If not, listen to me; <br /> &ensp;&ensp;be silent, and I will teach you wisdom." |
| 16 then he opens the ears of men <br /> &ensp;&ensp;and terrifies them with warnings,                         |                                                                                                           |
