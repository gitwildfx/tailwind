## The test of attrition

All of us can identify with the struggles of learning new and difficult things. My first exposure to basic programming came through a free workshop on <a href="https://www.powershellengineer.com/archive" target="_blank">Powershell</a>. I need the skill for a job as a System Administrator, but for the life of me, I couldn't figure it out. In hindsight, those were the baby steps in my coding journey.

### Defined.

<b>at·tri·tion</b>
<em>/əˈtriSHən/</em>
noun
1. the action or process of gradually reducing the strength or effectiveness of someone or something through sustained attack or pressure.

When considering the trials and challenges we each face in life, the biblical story of <a href="https://bibleproject.com/guides/book-of-job/" target="_blank">Job</a> often comes to remembrance. Essentially, Job was a righteous man who was allowed by God to be tested by the devil. This should all make us cringe to some degree, but it's important when considering the many difficulties we'll face on a coding project, technical interview, or workplace drama as developers. I recall many late evenings hammering away on code to no avail \:/

### Example (Job 33):

|                                                                                                           |                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 But now, hear my speech, O Job,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and listen to all my words.<br />                        | 18 he keeps back his soul from the pit,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;his life from perishing by the sword.<br />         |
| 2 Behold, I open my mouth;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;the tongue in my mouth speaks.<br />                             | 19 "Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and with continual strife in his bones,<br />   |
| 3 My words declare the uprightness of my<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;heart,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and what my lips know they speak<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;sincerely.<br /> | 20 so that his life loathes bread,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and his appetite the choicest food.<br />               |
| 4 The Spirit of God has made me,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and the breath of the Almighty gives me<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;life.<br /> | 21 His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;seen,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and his bones that were not seen stick out.<br /> |
| 5 Answer me, if you can;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;set your words in order before me; take<br /> &ensp;&ensp;your stand.<br /> | 22 His soul draws near the pit,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and his life to those who bring death.<br />                 |
| 6 Behold, I am toward God as you are;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;I too was pinched off from a piece of<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;clay.<br /> | 23 If there be for him an angel,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;a mediator, one of the thousand,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;to declare to man what is right for him,<br /> |
| 7 Behold, no fear of me need terrify you;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;my pressure will not be heavy upon you.<br />        | 24 and he is merciful to him, and says,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;'Deliver him from going down into the pit;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;I have found a ransom;<br /> |
| 8 "Surely you have spoken in my ears,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and I have heard the sound of your<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;words.<br /> | 25 let his flesh become fresh with youth;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;let him return to the days of his youthful<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;vigor';<br /> |
| 9 You say, 'I am pure, without transgression;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;I am clean, and there is no iniquity in<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;me.<br /> | 26 then man prays to God, and he accepts him;<br /> &ensp;&ensp; he sees his face with a shout of joy,<br /> and he restores to man his righteousness.<br /> |
| 10 Behold, he finds occasions against me,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;he counts me as his enemy,<br />                    | 27&ensp;&ensp;He sings before men and says:<br /> 'I have sinned and perverted what was right,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and it was not repaid to me.<br /> |
| 11 he puts my feet in the stocks<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and watches all my paths,'<br />                           | 28 He has redeemed my soul from going down<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;into the pit,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and my life shall look upon the light.'<br /> |
| 12 "Behold, in this you are not right. I will<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;answer you,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;for God is greater than man.<br /> | 29 "Behold, God does all these things,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;twice, three times, with a man,<br />                  |
| 13 Why do you contend against him,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;saying, 'He will answer none of man's<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;words'?<br /> | 30 to bring back his soul from the pit,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;that he may be lighted with the light of<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;life.<br /> |
| 14 For God speaks in one way,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and in two, though man does not per-<br /> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;ceive it.<br /> | 31 Pay attention, O Job, listen to me;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;be silent, and I will speak.<br />                |
| 15 In a dream, in a vision of the night,<br /> &ensp;&ensp;when deep sleep falls on men,<br />                  | 32 If you have any words, answer me;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;speak, for I desire to justify you.<br />              |
| 16 then he opens the ears of men<br /> &ensp;&ensp;and terrifies them with warnings,<br />                    | 33 If not, listen to me;<br /> &ensp;&ensp;be silent, and I will teach you wisdom." |
|                                                                                                           |                                                                                                           |
