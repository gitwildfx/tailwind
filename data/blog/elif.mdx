Some decisions in life arenâ€™t simple **Yes/No** answers (i.e., **boolean**). Often, we need additional pieces of information to help us navigate the way beyond and through. When we logically think of coding problems, similar scenarios are presented.

### Python's `elif` Keyword

In Python, the **`elif`** keyword is used in conditional statements, which allow your programs to execute certain code based on the evaluation of conditions. The **`elif`** stands for "else if," and it provides a way to check multiple expressions for truth and executes a code block once the conditions are met.

#### Basic Structure of `if-elif-else`

Here's the basic structure of an **`if-elif-else`** statement:

```python
if condition1:
    # code block 1

elif condition2:
    # code block 2

else: 
    # code block 3
```

*   `if condition1` - This checks if `condition1` is `True`. If it is, the program executes **code block 1**.

*   `elif condition2` - If `condition1` is not `True`, the program checks `condition2`. If `condition2` is `True`, it executes **code block 2.**

*   `else` (_optional_) - If neither `condition1` nor `condition2` is `True`, the program defaults to executing **code block 3**.

When considering the many possible decisions and outcomes you face, know there are often multiple conditions at play. Perhaps youâ€™re struggling with an issue, or trying to understand your purpose in life. Just make the next best choice and leave the rest to God. Give yourself an `if` (or `elif`) and make sure to check your syntax. ðŸ˜‰
