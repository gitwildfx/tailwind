# Introduction
Help Leo, a brave lion cub, navigate the jungle and find his way back to his pride! Use your Python skills to guide him through challenges and reunite him with his family.

## Lab 1: Welcome to the Jungle!
**Learn**: Print statements, Variables  
**Goal**: Print a welcome message with Leo's name and age (e.g., "Hello! I'm Leo, a 2-year-old lion cub").

```python
leo_name = "Leo"
leo_age = 2
print(f"Hello! I'm {leo_name}, a {leo_age}-year-old lion cub.")
```

## Lab 2: River Crossing  
**Learn**: Input function, Conditional statements (if/else)  
**Goal**: Help Leo decide how to cross the river.

```python
has_bridge = input("Is there a bridge? (True/False): ").strip().lower() == 'true'
if has_bridge:
    print("Leo crosses the river safely.")
else:
    print("No bridge! Help Leo find a log.")
```

## Lab 3: Log Rolling  
**Learn**: Loops (for)  
**Goal**: Loop through 5 logs and check if one is suitable.

```python
logs = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]  # Length of the logs in meters
suitable_log = None
for log in logs:
    if log > 3:
        suitable_log = log
        print(f"Leo can use the {log}-meter long log.")
        break

if suitable_log is None:
    print("No suitable log found!")
```

## Lab 4: Monkey Mayhem!  
**Learn**: Functions  
**Goal**: Create a function to reduce the banana count.

```python
bananas = 5

def monkey_steal(banana_count):
    return banana_count - 2

bananas = monkey_steal(bananas)
print(f"Leo now has {bananas} bananas.")
```

## Lab 5: Helpful Toucan  
**Learn**: Lists, String manipulation  
**Goal**: Print each direction with an arrow.

```python
directions = ["North", "East", "South", "West"]
for direction in directions:
    print(f"{direction} ->")
```

## Lab 6: Memory Test  
**Learn**: While loops  
**Goal**: Help Leo remember the toucan's directions.

```python
correct_direction = "North"
user_direction = ""
while user_direction != correct_direction:
    user_direction = input("Which direction did the toucan say? ").strip()
    if user_direction == correct_direction:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Try again.")
```

## Lab 7: Fruit Feast  
**Learn**: Random numbers  
**Goal**: Random fruit from a tree.

```python
import random

fruit = random.randint(1, 3)

if fruit == 1:
  print("Leo found a delicious mango!")
elif fruit == 2:
  print("Yum! Leo found a banana.")
else:
  print("Leo enjoys a handful of sweet berries.")
```

## Lab 8: River Rescue  
**Learn**: String formatting (f-strings), lists, conditionals (if/else)  
**Goal**: Help Leo rescue baby monkeys.

```python
monkey_names = ["Lulu", "Milo"]

print("Oh no! Monkeys, Lulu and Milo, are stranded on opposite sides of the river!")

# Let the user choose who to rescue first
while True:
  choice = input("Who will Leo save first? (1. Lulu or 2. Milo) ").upper()

  if choice in ("1", "LULU"):
    rescued_monkey = "Lulu"
    break
  elif choice in ("2", "MILO"):
    rescued_monkey = "Milo"
    break
  else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please choose 1 or 2.")

# Print rescue message with f-string
print(f"Leo bravely swims across the river and rescues {rescued_monkey}!")
```

## Lab 9: Cave Challenge  
**Learn**: Dictionaries  
**Goal**: Create a dictionary for cave exits.

```python
cave_exits = {
  "North": "dark and scary",
  "East": "bright and sunny",
  "South": "full of bats (yikes!)",
  "West": "a narrow passage leading deeper into the cave"
}

user_choice = input("Leo stands at a crossroads in the cave. Which direction will he go? (North, East, South, West) ").capitalize()

if user_choice in cave_exits:
  print(f"The exit to the {user_choice} looks {cave_exits[user_choice]}.")
else:
  print("That direction seems like a dead end. Better choose another path!")
```

## Lab 10 (Bonus): The Wise Old Elephant  
**Learn**: Data Structures (Lists, Tuples)  
**Goal**: Solve riddles with Lists and Tuples.

```python
# A list of riddles and their corresponding answers as tuples
riddles_and_answers = [
  ("I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish. What am I?", "Map"),
  ("I am always coming, but never arrive. I am always present, but never here. What am I?", "Tomorrow")
]

user_score = 0  # Track Leo's score

# Loop through riddles and present them to the user
for riddle, answer in riddles_and_answers:
  print(f"\nThe wise old elephant asks:")
  print(riddle)
  guess = input("What is your guess? ")

  if guess.strip().lower() == answer.lower():
    user_score += 1
    print(f"You're right! That's {user_score} out of {len(riddles_and_answers)} riddles solved.")
  else:
    print(f"Not quite. The answer is {answer}.")

# Share the overall lesson learned
learned_lesson = "We all need help in our journey... 'Keep going, you're doing great!'"

print(f"\nLeo ponders the lesson: {learned_lesson}.")
```
