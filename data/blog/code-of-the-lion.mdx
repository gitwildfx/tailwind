## Introduction
<b>Hello World!</b><br />
> My name is Leo, your friendly lion cub. I need your help because I'm a bit lost in the jungle. I'm supposed to be the King, or at least in training. There are many surprises and dangers lurking around these parts. Will you help me find my way back home? Oh, and keep this between us for now ("Lion's Code").

## Lab 1: Welcome to the Jungle!
**Learn**: Print statements, Variables  
**Goal**: Print a welcome message with Leo's name and age (e.g., "Hello! I'm Leo, a 2-year-old lion cub").

```python
leo_name = "Leo"
leo_age = 2
print(f"Hello! I'm {leo_name}, a {leo_age}-year-old lion cub.")
```

## Lab 2: River Crossing  
**Learn**: Input function, Conditional statements (if/else)  
**Goal**: Help Leo decide how to cross the river.

```python
has_bridge = input("Is there a bridge? (True/False): ").strip().lower() == 'true'
if has_bridge:
    print("Leo crosses the river safely.")
else:
    print("No bridge! Help Leo find a log.")
```

## Lab 3: Log Rolling  
**Learn**: Loops (for)  
**Goal**: Loop through 5 logs and check if one is suitable.

```python
logs = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]  # Length of the logs in meters
suitable_log = None
for log in logs:
    if log > 3:
        suitable_log = log
        print(f"Leo can use the {log}-meter long log.")
        break

if suitable_log is None:
    print("No suitable log found!")
```

## Lab 4: Monkey Mayhem!  
**Learn**: Functions  
**Goal**: Create a function to reduce the banana count.

```python
bananas = 5

def monkey_steal(banana_count):
    return banana_count - 2

bananas = monkey_steal(bananas)
print(f"Leo now has {bananas} bananas.")
```

## Lab 5: Helpful Toucan  
**Learn**: Lists, String manipulation  
**Goal**: Print each direction with an arrow.

```python
directions = ["North", "East", "South", "West"]
for direction in directions:
    print(f"{direction} ->")
```

## Lab 6: Memory Test  
**Learn**: While loops  
**Goal**: Help Leo remember the toucan's directions.

```python
correct_direction = "North"
user_direction = ""
while user_direction != correct_direction:
    user_direction = input("Which direction did the toucan say? ").strip()
    if user_direction == correct_direction:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Try again.")
```

## Lab 7: Fruit Feast  
**Learn**: Random numbers  
**Goal**: Random fruit from a tree.

```python
import random

fruit = random.randint(1, 3)

if fruit == 1:
  print("Leo found a delicious mango!")
elif fruit == 2:
  print("Yum! Leo found a banana.")
else:
  print("Leo enjoys a handful of sweet berries.")
```

## Lab 8: River Rescue  
**Learn**: String formatting (f-strings), lists, conditionals (if/else)  
**Goal**: Help Leo rescue baby monkeys.

```python
monkey_names = ["Lulu", "Milo"]

print("Oh no! Monkeys, Lulu and Milo, are stranded on opposite sides of the river!")

# Let the user choose who to rescue first
while True:
  choice = input("Who will Leo save first? (1. Lulu or 2. Milo) ").upper()

  if choice in ("1", "LUULU"):
    rescued_monkey = "Lulu"
    break
  elif choice in ("2", "MILO"):
    rescued_monkey = "Milo"
    break
  else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please choose 1 or 2.")

# Print rescue message with f-string
print(f"Leo bravely swims across the river and rescues {rescued_monkey}!")
```

## Lab 9: Cave Challenge  
**Learn**: Dictionaries  
**Goal**: Create a dictionary for cave exits.

```python
cave_exits = {
  "North": "dark and scary",
  "East": "bright and sunny",
  "South": "full of bats (yikes!)",
  "West": "a narrow passage leading deeper into the cave"
}

user_choice = input("Leo stands at a crossroads in the cave. Which direction will he go? (North, East, South, West) ").capitalize()

if user_choice in cave_exits:
  print(f"The exit to the {user_choice} looks {cave_exits[user_choice]}.")
else:
  print("That direction seems like a dead end. Better choose another path!")
```

## Lab 10 (Bonus): The Wise Old Elephant  
**Learn**: Data Structures (Lists, Tuples)  
**Goal**: Solve riddles with Lists and Tuples.

```python
# A list of riddles and their corresponding answers as tuples
riddles_and_answers = [
  ("I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish. What am I?", "Map"),
  ("I am always coming, but never arrive. I am always present, but never here. What am I?", "Tomorrow")
]

user_score = 0  # Track Leo's score

# Loop through riddles and present them to the user
for riddle, answer in riddles_and_answers:
  print(f"\nThe wise old elephant asks:")
  print(riddle)
  guess = input("What is your guess? ")

  if guess.lower() == answer.lower():
    user_score += 1
    print(f"You're right! That's {user_score} out of {len(riddles_and_answers)} riddles solved.")
  else:
    print(f"Not quite. The answer is {answer}.")

# Share the overall lesson learned
learned_lesson = "We all need help in our journey... 'Keep going, you're doing great!'"

print(f"\nLeo ponders the lesson: {learned_lesson}.")
```
