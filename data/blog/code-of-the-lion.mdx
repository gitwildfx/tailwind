# Code of the Lion: A Python Adventure Game
Help Leo, a brave lion cub, navigate the jungle and find his way back to his pride! Use your Python skills to guide him through challenges and reunite him with his family.

## Lab 1: Welcome to the Jungle!
**Learn**: Print statements, Variables  
**Goal**: Print a welcome message with Leo's name and age (e.g., "Hello! I'm Leo, a 2-year-old lion cub").

```python
leo_name = "Leo"
leo_age = 2
print(f"Hello! I'm {leo_name}, a {leo_age}-year-old lion cub.")
```

## Lab 2: River Crossing  
**Learn**: Input function, Conditional statements (if/else)  
**Goal**: Help Leo decide how to cross the river.

```python
has_bridge = input("Is there a bridge? (True/False): ").strip().lower() == 'true'
if has_bridge:
    print("Leo crosses the river safely.")
else:
    print("No bridge! Help Leo find a log.")

## Lab 3: Log Rolling  
**Learn**: Loops (for)  
**Goal**: Loop through 5 logs and check if one is suitable.

```python
logs = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]  # Length of the logs in meters
suitable_log = None
for log in logs:
    if log > 3:
        suitable_log = log
        print(f"Leo can use the {log}-meter long log.")
        break

if suitable_log is None:
    print("No suitable log found!")
```

## Lab 4: Monkey Mayhem!  
**Learn**: Functions  
**Goal**: Create a function to reduce the banana count.

```python
bananas = 5

def monkey_steal(banana_count):
    return banana_count - 2

bananas = monkey_steal(bananas)
print(f"Leo now has {bananas} bananas.")
```

## Lab 5: Helpful Toucan  
**Learn**: Lists, String manipulation  
**Goal**: Print each direction with an arrow.

```python
directions = ["North", "East", "South"]
for direction in directions:
    print(f"{direction} ->")
```

## Lab 6: Memory Test  
**Learn**: While loops  
**Goal**: Help Leo remember the toucan's directions.

```python
correct_direction = "North"
user_direction = ""
while user_direction != correct_direction:
    user_direction = input("Which direction did the toucan say? ").strip()
    if user_direction == correct_direction:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Try again.")
```

## Lab 7: Fruit Feast  
**Learn**: Random numbers  
**Goal**: Random fruit from a tree.

```python
import random

fruit_type = random.randint(1, 3)
if fruit_type == 1:
    fruit = "mango"
elif fruit_type == 2:
    fruit = "banana"
else:
    fruit = "berries"
print(f"Leo found a {fruit} on the tree.")
```

## Lab 8: River Rescue  
**Learn**: String formatting (f-strings), lists, conditionals (if/else)  
**Goal**: Help Leo rescue baby monkeys.

```python
baby_monkeys = ["Monkey 1", "Monkey 2", "Monkey 3"]
print("Choose which monkey to save first:")
for i, monkey in enumerate(baby_monkeys, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {monkey}")
choice = int(input("Enter the number of the monkey to save: "))
if 1 <= choice <= len(baby_monkeys):
    print(f"Leo saved {baby_monkeys[choice - 1]}.")
else:
    print("Invalid choice!")
```

## Lab 9: Cave Challenge  
**Learn**: Dictionaries  
**Goal**: Create a dictionary for cave exits.

```python
exits = {
    "North": "dark and scary",
    "East": "bright and sunny",
    "South": "narrow and damp",
    "West": "cold and windy"
}
print("Cave Exits:")
for direction, description in exits.items():
    print(f"{direction}: {description}")
```

## Lab 10 (Bonus): The Wise Old Elephant  
**Learn**: Data Structures (Lists, Tuples)  
**Goal**: Solve riddles with Lists and Tuples.

```python
riddles = [("What has keys but can't open locks?", "Piano"),
           ("What has feet but can't walk?", "Table"),
           ("What has a face but can't smile?", "Clock")]
print("Riddles from the Wise Old Elephant:")
for riddle, answer in riddles:
    print(f"Riddle: {riddle}")
    user_answer = input("Your answer: ").strip()
    if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print(f"Wrong! The correct answer is: {answer}")
```
