You may have already noticed the icon and color scheme of our site has changed to a fun 8-bit layout. The reason was to tease out another core component of a developer’s toolbox: [YAML](https://yaml.org/).

Recently, Microsoft unveiled some changes to its Power Fx development stack with its introduction of [Code View](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/blog/power-apps/introducing-code-view-in-power-apps-studio-public-preview/). Among other notable enhancements were extensions for Visual Studio Code and the ability to *copy code* for use with other Power Apps components.

YAML brings the underlying Power Fx language into a clean readable format that enables developers to format and execute code more efficiently. This seems to be the logical progression for Microsoft’s low-code platform, along with [Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio), which we’ll cover in a follow-up article.

It’s important to note that YAML is not a new technology. In fact, markup languages have been in use for some time often to create configuration files which naturally works well with programming languages \[1\]. YAML is also designed for ease of use and client interactions, making it a popular tool among developers \[2\]. Ultimately, these features enable greater extensibility across diverse coding languages.
