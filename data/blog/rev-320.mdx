### We Won't Learn Unless We First Seek

I remember a technical leader telling me once that if you don’t speak up you won’t receive. It sounded simple and childlike, but behind that statement is a nugget of wisdom that I think even infants understand.

> "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened." (Matthew 7:7-8 BSB)

Since beginning this blog, I knew I wanted to incorporate coding and faith concepts. Historically, these two areas were seen as mirror opposites (i.e. “Mark of the Beast”). No, but seriously. I’m fascinated by why there seems to be a growing disparity in the culture when it comes to God and the machines we use daily.

Even modern programming languages rely on user inputs, whether from a terminal prompt or a complicated query like Chat-GPT. We all are designed to search and make sense of our reality. If we abstract that principle to its highest degree, I believe we’ll get to God and Truth. The question becomes then, will that be from us… or Him?

> Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with Me. (Revelations 3:20 BSB)
