## The Arc of Technological Change

In my generation, I've witnessed many new things. Modern computing, the Internet, and now Artificial Intelligence have swept the world over. Companies like **OpenAI**, **Microsoft**, **DeepSeek**, **Claude**, **xAI**, **Gemini**, and countless others are probing the depths of AI and altering how we think and interact with information.

With changing cultural norms, social and political challenges, and a global economic crisis emerging—not to mention a host of personal and societal struggles—one could hardly imagine an optimistic future.

## The Fourth Industrial Revolution

As a developer and citizen of humanity, I'm often overwhelmed with the coming fourth industrial revolution. What will the near future look like with advancements in genetics, augmented reality, robotics, and the like?

Will we still be creating content, or will machines be providing us with an endless stream of dopamine-laden experiences connected directly to a neural network?

*Great, now I'm sounding weird.*

## Practical Tools and Learning

*"Excuse me—can we get to some code, please?"* Yes, we will.

```text
"God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us. This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God’s inner sanctuary. Jesus has already gone in there for us. He has become our eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek."  
(Hebrews 6:18-20 NLT)
