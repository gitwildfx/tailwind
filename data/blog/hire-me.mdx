### Landing the Tech Job... and Keeping It!

According to the [U.S. Bureau of Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6), employment of software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers is projected to grow **25 percent** from 2022 to 2032, much faster than the average for all occupations.

Since we’re on the topic of “development,” I thought to include some helpful interview tips and lessons learned for anyone wanting to get into tech:

1.  Start building your professional resume now. Use anything you have (work, education, projects, etc.) and convert what you’ve learned to marketable **skills**.
    
2.  Think **project** **experience** over specific jobs or certifications you may possess.
    
3.  [Hire a professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendykraftusa/) to review your resume, and study everything on it.
    
4.  Interview prep before game day. It shows!
    
5.  Invest in a solid career-focused [boot camp](https://betheltech.net/). A 6-9 month “job-ready” program, with proven hirings, can often outpace a traditional 4-year degree program. (\*Note: have your company pay for your college education while you’re actively employed).
    
6.  _Patience_ and _vision_ are keys to unlocking future success, both in career and life.
    
7.  **Be thankful**, even if you didn’t get the job. Someone else may have been waiting longer than you for it.
    

**(Pro Tip):** During a technical interview, ask to share your screen and present specifics about your job. Having an environment prepped beforehand (with sample code and news articles about your desired company) will set you apart from other candidates while demonstrating you’re ready to contribute on day one.

Finally, if you want the job, let them know: _**“I really want to work for this company!”**_
